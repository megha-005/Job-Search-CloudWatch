# Key Technologies and Skills
***Python frameworks***

Django, Flask, and increasingly FastAPI are the mainstays for backend web development.

***AWS Services***

Regular use of Lambda, EC2, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, and API Gateway is expected, with knowledge of IAM, AWS CLI, and deployment best practices.

***Databases***

Both SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (DynamoDB, MongoDB, Redis) technologies are required, especially for scalable, cloud-native applications.

***API Design***

RESTful API and, occasionally, GraphQL API development, integrating authentication (OAuth, JWT), best practices, and third-party APIs.

***DevOps & Testing***

Familiarity with CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, version control (notably Git), infrastructure as code (Terraform, CloudFormation), and automated testing frameworks (PyTest, UnitTest).

## Interview Focus Areas
Coding questions on Python syntax, data structures, and algorithms.

Problem-solving and architectural scenarios, like building scalable APIs and choosing between SQL vs. NoSQL databases.

Cloud integration, microservices, and serverless computing skills.

Practical tasks involving API design, database queries, async programming, and deploying on AWS.

Knowledge and hands-on questions on security (encryption, authentication), database optimization, and CI/CD pipelines.

Assessment of soft skills: communication, teamwork, and adaptability in agile/cloud-based team environments.

## LinkedIn Job Trends
The majority of AWS Python backend roles list experience with Django, Flask, SQL/NoSQL, AWS core services, and DevOps as must-haves.

Positions often also require experience integrating with APIs, proficiency with Docker or Kubernetes, and a demonstrated ability to deploy, monitor, and optimize cloud-native apps.
