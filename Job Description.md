Experience: 5+ years
Location: Remote (Global applicants welcome)

We're looking for a skilled Backend Engineer who loves building robust backend services using Python (Django or similar), has solid experience with databases, and is confident deploying applications on AWS.

This is your chance to join a fast-growing AI startup and build the backend systems that power intelligent applications. While this role focuses on backend engineering, weâ€™ll give you exposure to GenAI and LLM technologies, helping you learn and grow on the job. If youâ€™ve already worked with LLMs or Generative AIâ€”awesome. If not, weâ€™ll make sure you do.

âœ… What weâ€™re looking for:
5+ years of experience in Python backend development
Hands-on experience with Django, Flask, or FastAPI
Strong knowledge of relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
Experience working with cloud services (preferably AWS â€“ EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, etc.)
Ability to design clean, scalable APIs and microservices
Comfortable working in a fast-paced, agile, remote environment
ðŸ’¡ Bonus if you have:
Any experience with GenAI, LangChain, LLM APIs, or vector databases
Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines, Docker, or Kubernetes
Interest in building data-intensive or AI-powered products
ðŸš€ What youâ€™ll get:
Work directly with the founder and a highly technical team
Exposure to exciting GenAI and AI-backed products
A collaborative, remote-first environment
A chance to grow into AI/LLM engineering roles

ðŸš¨ Please note: This is not a Data Scientist / AI role. ðŸš¨

We will have those roles soon, but this opportunity is focused more on backend services and cloud deployments.
